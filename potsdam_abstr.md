# dpcReport -- POC tests analysis framework  

Point-of-Care tests brings the medical examination to the patient. The hardware necessary for such diagnosis should be completed with a suitably portable analysis framework. We introduce dpcReport, a versatile open source cross-platform software for analysis of digital PCR (dPCR) experiments. It might be accessed as a web server from any modern personal computer or even a smartphone, greatly enhancing its portability.  

The functionalities of dpcReport include summary statistics alongside with appropriate charts, novel experiments comparison methods and quality control of input data. To streamline data analysis, the most fundamental elements of input objects can be edited directly in dpcReport, removing the need for additional data management.  

The dpcReport is a Graphical User Interface based on dpcR package for statistical computing environment R. All functionalities are also accessible through a command-line, which also allows for a more sophisticated analysis tailored for expectations of a researcher. To streamline the conversion between GUI and R script, the dpcReport automatically generates R code which can be easily customized.  

The dpcR web-server can be accessed under the address http://www.smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/dpcReport. The stand-alone version for the Microsoft Windows platform can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/dpcreport/.
